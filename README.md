# My custom linux installation scripts

## Usage
* Clone the repo, run `chmod a+x *.sh && chmod a+x mtrack/*.sh`
* Then run `./install-apt.sh` if you are using a distro that has the aptitude package manager.
If you know how to install mtrack and you are using a macbook 13,1 then go ahead and explore my mtrack configuration and install it if you wish.
